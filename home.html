            Counterfeit money refers to fake or imitation currency that is produced with an idea to deceive. According to recent reports, demonetization led to all-time high inflow of fake notes into banks, resulting in a spike in suspicious transactions. The existing works to detect a counterfeit note are mostly based on image processing techniques. This paper deals with Deep Learning in which a convolution neural network(CNN) model is built with a motive to identify a counterfeit note on handy devices like smart phones, tablets. The model built was trained and tested on a self-generated dataset. Images are acquired using the smart phone camera and fed to the CNN network. The results obtained are encouraging and can be improvised by further research and improvements in the architecture of Deep CNN model. The testing accuracy obtained is about 85.6%, training and the validation accuracy were 98.57% and 96.55% respectively.

                In this paper, the Automatic Fake Currency Recognition System (AFCRS) is designed to detect the counterfeit paper currency to check whether it is fake or original. The existing counterfeit problem due to demonetization effects the banking system and also in other fields. A new approach of Convolution Neural Network towards identification of fake currency notes through their images is examined in this paper which is comparatively better than previous image processing techniques. This method is based on Deep Learning, which has seen tremendous success in image classification tasks in recent times. This technique can help both people and machine in identifying a fake currency note in real time through an image of the same. The proposed system, AFCRS can also be deployed as an application in the smartphone which can help the society to distinguish between the fake and original currency notes. The Accuracy in the proposed system can be increased through the original fake notes, where as the proposed system contains the images from childrenâ€™s bank churan label.
